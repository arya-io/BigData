# 🚀 How Companies Start  

### Understanding Data Exchange in Business  
Before diving into **Kafka**, let's understand how companies begin handling data.

🔹 At the start, things are **simple**:  
   - There's **one** source system (where data is generated).  
   - There's **one** target system (where data is needed).  
   - These two systems **exchange data** between each other seamlessly.

---

# ⚡ Scaling Up: More Systems, More Complexity  

🔹 As a company **grows**, things get complicated:  
   - **Multiple** source systems emerge, generating diverse data.  
   - **Multiple** target systems appear, each requiring different data.  
   - **Tight coupling** occurs, meaning systems become heavily dependent on each other.  
   - We **can't easily separate them**, making modifications a headache!  

📌 The more systems interact, the harder it becomes to **manage data flow**.

---

# ❌ Challenges in Traditional Architectures  

Let's say we have **4 source systems** and **6 target systems**.  
🔹 To **connect** them all, we'd need **24 integrations** 😵!  

Each integration comes with **major challenges**:  
✅ **Protocol Issues** – How should data move? (TCP, HTTP, REST, FTP, JDBC...)  
✅ **Data Format Problems** – How should we structure data? (Binary, CSV, JSON, Avro...)  
✅ **Data Schema Evolution** – How will data **change** over time?  
✅ **High System Load** – Every new connection **adds stress** to the system.  

🎯 **Clearly, this isn’t scalable!** Companies **struggle** to manage data efficiently.  
So... how do we **solve** this problem? 🤔  

---

# 🌟 Solution: Apache Kafka  

🎯 This is where **Apache Kafka** comes in! 🚀  

🔹 Kafka **decouples** data streams, making systems **independent**.  
🔹 Now, instead of direct exchanges between systems:  
   - **Source systems** send data to **Kafka**.  
   - **Target systems** **fetch data** from **Kafka**.  

💡 **No more tight coupling!** Kafka acts as a **middle layer**, simplifying data flow.

# 🔄 Kafka Enables Flexible Data Flow  

Kafka allows **any type of data stream** to flow through it:  
✅ Log files  
✅ Transactions  
✅ Sensor data  
✅ Messages from applications  

🔹 Once data is inside **Kafka**, it can be sent to **any system** efficiently!  
📌 Think of it as a **super-fast messenger** that **delivers data smoothly**. 🚀

✅ **Real-Time Decisions** – Uber adjusting prices based on demand.  
✅ **Real-Time Insights** – Businesses analyzing customer behavior instantly.  

📌 **But remember**, Kafka is just a **transport mechanism**!  
📌 Applications still **need logic** to process and use data effectively.  
📌 Kafka ensures **data moves FAST at scale!** 🚀  

---

# 🏗️ Kafka Fundamentals  

### 🎯 Topics, Partitions & Offsets  
Kafka organizes data into **topics**, which are like database **tables**:  
✅ **Topics** – A categorized stream of data (e.g., GPS locations, logs).  
✅ **Partitions** – Topics are **split** into partitions for **parallelism**.  
✅ **Ordered Messages** – Each partition maintains an **ordered sequence**.  
✅ **Offsets** – Each message gets a **unique ID** (**incremental counter**) for tracking.  

📌 Kafka stores **an infinite** number of messages over time—data **never stops** flowing! 🌊  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/097b49a7-273c-4cfc-b1b3-49a4da50c51a)

---

# 🚚 Topic Example: `trucks_gps`  

### 🚛 Real-Time Truck Tracking with Kafka  
🔹 Imagine a **fleet of trucks**, each reporting **GPS** location data.  
🔹 Kafka can handle a **trucks_gps** topic, storing positions for all trucks.  
🔹 Each truck **sends a message** every **20 seconds** containing:  
   - **Truck ID**  
   - **Latitude & Longitude**  

📌 The topic can have **10 partitions** to distribute load efficiently.  

🔹 Two applications use this data:  
✅ **Location Dashboard** – Displays truck positions visually.  
✅ **Notification Service** – Alerts users when trucks enter/exist regions.

# 🏗️ Kafka Fundamentals: Topics, Partitions & Offsets  

### 🔍 Understanding Offsets in Kafka  

Kafka breaks data into **topics**, which are further divided into **partitions**.  
Each partition ensures **message ordering** and assigns an **offset** (a unique ID).  

✅ **Offsets only apply within a single partition** – meaning:  
   - Offset **3 in Partition 0** ≠ Offset **3 in Partition 1** – **They hold different data!**  
✅ **Ordering is only guaranteed within a partition**, not across multiple partitions.  
✅ **Data retention is temporary** – usually **one week** by default.  
✅ **Immutability** – Once data is **written**, it **cannot be changed**.  
✅ **Random partition assignment** – Unless a **key** is provided, Kafka assigns data randomly.  

📌 Kafka ensures fast and **reliable** data processing while keeping old data available for a limited time.

---

# 💡 Brokers: The Backbone of Kafka  

### 🔎 What Are Brokers?  
A **Kafka cluster** is made up of **brokers** – powerful servers that store and manage data.  

✅ **Brokers hold topics & partitions**, acting as storage nodes.  
✅ **Each broker** has a unique **ID** (integer).  
✅ **Each broker contains different partitions from multiple topics**.  
✅ Once connected to **any broker** (called a **bootstrap broker**), you are connected to the **entire cluster**.  
✅ A beginner-friendly setup starts with **3 brokers**, but massive clusters **can have 100+ brokers**!  

📌 **Think of brokers as the "warehouse managers" of Kafka** – they ensure data storage and accessibility at scale!  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81b502f9-4e98-4618-8a5b-cc4ce6112abf)

---

# 🔄 Brokers & Topics: Data Distribution  

Kafka distributes **topics and partitions** across multiple brokers for **scalability**.  

Example setup:  
✅ **Topic-A** with **three partitions**, spread across **three brokers**.  
✅ **Topic-B** with **two partitions**, but **Broker 103 doesn’t store any Topic-B data**.  

📌 Data gets **spread efficiently** among brokers, preventing overload on a single machine.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4abfb86a-192f-4a09-8764-084f8665b4b9)

---

# 🛠️ Fault Tolerance: Topic Replication Factor  

Kafka ensures **data resilience** through replication.  

✅ **Replication Factor** > 1 ensures **fault tolerance**.  
✅ Standard replication is **2 or 3** copies per partition.  
✅ If **one broker fails**, other brokers **still serve the data**.  

### 🔥 Real-World Example  
🎯 **Cluster with 3 Brokers**  
🎯 **Topic-A with 2 partitions & replication factor = 2**  

🚨 **Broker 102 fails**…  
✅ **Broker 101 & 103 still have the data, ensuring zero data loss!**  

📌 **Replication is critical for Kafka clusters—it prevents failures from disrupting data flow!**  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c368d58e-8abe-45e1-beae-4c04ec9efea9)  

🔥 Even if **one server goes down**, **Kafka ensures business continuity**.

---

# ⚡ Concept of Leader for a Partition  

Kafka **organizes data into partitions**, but **who manages** them?  

### 🔹 Partition Leadership  
✅ **Only ONE broker** acts as the **leader** for each partition at a time.  
✅ **The leader broker** is responsible for **receiving & serving data** for that partition.  
✅ **Other brokers act as followers** and **synchronize the data** from the leader.  
✅ Each partition has **one leader** and multiple **ISRs (In-Sync Replicas)**.  

📌 If the leader broker **fails**, Kafka **elects** a new leader automatically to **ensure data availability**.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bf28d1d-3290-451a-9bfd-2ec101fbb3f0)

---

# 📝 Producers: Writing Data to Kafka  

### 🔎 What Are Producers?  
Producers are applications that **write data** to Kafka topics.  
✅ Producers **automatically decide** which **broker** and **partition** to send data to.  
✅ If a **broker fails**, producers **auto-recover** to prevent disruption.  

📌 Think of **producers** as **data suppliers**—sending messages efficiently into Kafka!  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a072ff1-3d5d-49c5-9d6b-d3aed228c9b3)

---

# 🔄 Producer Acknowledgements (acks)  

Kafka provides **three levels** of **data write acknowledgements**:  

✅ **acks=0** – Producer **does not wait** for confirmation (fastest, but risk of **data loss**).  
✅ **acks=1** – Producer waits for **leader acknowledgement** (**low risk** of data loss).  
✅ **acks=all** – Leader **plus all in-sync replicas** acknowledge the write (**no data loss**).  

📌 **Stronger acknowledgements = Higher data safety** 🔥  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acfecfbb-0b18-4465-9be1-c8f8417a8caa)

---

# 🔑 Producers & Message Keys  

### Why Use Keys?  
✅ **Producers can attach a key** (e.g., **truck ID, user ID**) to each message.  
✅ If **key=null**, messages are **sent randomly** in a **round-robin** fashion across partitions.  
✅ If a **key is provided**, all messages with the same key **go to the same partition**.  
✅ This is **essential for maintaining order** in case-specific fields need sequential tracking.  

📌 Example:  
🚚 **Tracking Truck GPS Data** – All messages from a **specific truck ID** must go into the **same partition** for accurate ordering.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61b03f6c-e897-489b-a015-a98be1df78c2)

---

# 📥 Consumers: Reading Data from Kafka  

### 🔹 What Are Consumers?  
Consumers are applications that **read and process data** from Kafka topics.  
✅ **Each consumer reads from a topic** identified by its **name**.  
✅ Consumers **automatically know** which broker to fetch data from.  
✅ If a **broker fails**, consumers **adjust** to read data from another available broker.  
✅ **Data is read in order within each partition** – ensuring **structured sequencing**.  

📌 **Consumers act as "data receivers," ensuring messages are properly retrieved and processed!**  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8964535b-df13-40c1-a275-ed2581b30841)

---

# 🔄 Consumer Groups: Parallel Data Processing  

### 🔍 What Are Consumer Groups?  
Consumers **read data efficiently** using **consumer groups**.  

✅ A **consumer group** allows multiple consumers to **share the workload**.  
✅ Each **consumer in the group** reads from **exclusive partitions**—ensuring **parallel processing**.  
✅ If there are **more consumers than partitions**, **some consumers remain inactive**.  

📌 **Consumers work together to distribute the data load!**  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/add1a59c-3ae4-41db-832d-7ab501d423b1)

---

# ❓ Too Many Consumers?  

### 🔎 What Happens If We Have More Consumers Than Partitions?  
✅ Kafka **assigns one partition per active consumer**.  
✅ If the **number of consumers exceeds partitions**, extra consumers **become inactive**.  
✅ They stay **connected** but **do not receive data** until partitions **increase** or **existing consumers drop off**.  

📌 **Always ensure the number of consumers aligns with partitions for efficient scaling!**  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b6006cc-14ec-4eae-9b62-e9a76e7d7615)

---

# 📌 Consumer Offsets: Tracking Read Data  

### 🔎 What Are Consumer Offsets?  
✅ Kafka **stores offsets** tracking the last read message for **each consumer group**.  
✅ These offsets live in a **special Kafka topic** called `__consumer_offsets`.  
✅ When a **consumer processes data**, it commits **the offset** for future retrieval.  
✅ If a **consumer crashes**, it can **resume reading** from the last committed offset.  

📌 **Offsets help ensure data continuity and prevent re-processing errors!**  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1248f177-0a2f-43a9-9c29-f95b49b7dbfb)

---

# 🎯 Consumer Delivery Semantics: Ensuring Reliability  

Consumers decide **when to commit offsets**, impacting **data reliability**.  

### 🔄 Three Delivery Semantics  

✅ **At Most Once** – Offsets are committed **as soon as the message is received**.  
   - 🚨 If processing **fails**, the message is **lost forever**!  

✅ **At Least Once** (Most Common) – Offsets are committed **after processing**.  
   - ⚠ If processing **fails**, the message **is re-read**, causing **possible duplicates**.  
   - 🛠 **Solution**: Make processing **idempotent** (re-processing should not impact results).  

✅ **Exactly Once** – Ensures **no duplicate reads** (Best reliability).  
   - 🔹 Achieved **within Kafka** using **Kafka Streams API**.  
   - 🔹 For **external system workflows**, use **an idempotent consumer**.  

📌 **Choosing the right delivery semantics is critical to avoid data loss and duplication!**  

---

# 🔎 Kafka Broker Discovery  

### 🔹 What Are Bootstrap Servers?  
✅ Every Kafka **broker** is known as a **bootstrap server**.  
✅ This means connecting to **any single broker** gives access to the **entire Kafka cluster**.  
✅ Each broker **stores metadata**, knowing about **all other brokers, topics, and partitions**.  

📌 **Connect to one broker, and you’re connected to them all!** 🚀  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6056ef0-d49e-496b-b323-8f896ba1d984)

---

# 🛠️ Zookeeper: The Backbone of Kafka  

### 🔎 Why Does Kafka Need Zookeeper?  
Zookeeper acts as Kafka’s **management system**, ensuring coordination across brokers.  

✅ **Tracks brokers** – Maintains a list of all active Kafka brokers.  
✅ **Handles leader election** – Decides which broker will lead each partition.  
✅ **Sends notifications** – Alerts Kafka when **brokers fail**, **new brokers join**, or **topics are modified**.  
✅ **Operates in odd-numbered clusters** – Usually **3, 5, or 7 servers** for **high availability**.  
✅ **Leader & Followers** – One **Zookeeper node** acts as the **leader** (handles writes), others as **followers** (handle reads).  
✅ **No Offset Storage** – Zookeeper **stopped storing consumer offsets** in Kafka **versions > 0.10**.  

📌 Without Zookeeper, Kafka **cannot function properly**!  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2fe444f-33db-4767-a76f-8863c1ec89a4)

---

# 🔄 Kafka Guarantees  

Kafka ensures **strong data reliability and consistency** with key guarantees:  

✅ **Ordered Message Processing** –  
   - Messages are **appended to a topic-partition** in **the order they’re sent**.  
   - Consumers read messages **in the same order they were stored**.  

✅ **High Fault Tolerance** –  
   - With a **replication factor of N**, producers/consumers can tolerate **up to (N-1) broker failures**.  
   - A **replication factor of 3** is ideal:  
     - Allows **one broker to be taken down** for maintenance.  
     - Allows **another broker to fail unexpectedly** without losing data.  

✅ **Consistent Message Routing** –  
   - As long as the **number of partitions remains constant**, messages with the same **key** always go to the **same partition**.  

📌 Kafka ensures **resilient and scalable** message handling while maintaining strict data ordering!

### 🚀 **Implementation of Apache Kafka**  

---

### 🔧 **Launching Kafka & Zookeeper**  

✔ **Start Zookeeper** 🏗  
```bash
bash run-kafka_zookeeper_server.sh -s start
```
✔ **Start Kafka Server** ⚙  
```bash
bash run-kafka_server.sh -s start
```
📌 **Checking Running Services**  
```bash
jps
```
💡 **Expected Output:**  
You should see `Kafka` and `QuorumPeerMain` running in the process list.  

---

### 🏗 **Working with Kafka Topics**  

✔ **View Documentation**  
```bash
kafka-topics.sh
```

✔ **Create a New Topic (`first_topic`)**  
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic first_topic --create
```

📌 **Issue:** If an error occurs, **Kafka may not show the error explicitly** but instead display the documentation.  

✔ **Specify Partitions (Fails without Replication Factor)**  
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic first_topic --create --partitions 3
```
❌ **Error:** Partitions must be accompanied by a **replication factor**.  

✔ **Set Partition & Replication Factor (Fails if brokers < Replication Factor)**  
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic first_topic --create --partitions 3 --replication-factor 2
```
⚠ **Warning:**  
_"Error while executing topic command: Replication factor (2) larger than available brokers (1)."_  
💡 **Solution:** Ensure enough brokers are running OR lower the replication factor.

✔ **Correct Topic Creation Command**  
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic first_topic --create --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
```
🎯 **Topic `first_topic` Created Successfully!**  

✔ **List Available Topics**  
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --list
```
✅ **Expected Output:**  
```bash
first_topic
```

---

### ✨ **Key Takeaways**  
✔ **Kafka needs Zookeeper to manage brokers** 🎯  
✔ **Partitions require replication factor** 🚀  
✔ **Insufficient brokers cause replication errors** ⚠  
✔ **Listing topics verifies successful creation** 📜  

---

### 🏗 **Working with Kafka Topics & Console Producer**  

---

### 🔎 **Describing Kafka Topics**  

📌 **View details of a topic (`first_topic`)**  
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic first_topic --describe
```
✅ **Expected Output:**  
| Topic  | Partition Count | Replication Factor | Leader | Replicas | ISR |
|--------|----------------|--------------------|--------|----------|-----|
| first_topic | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

💡 **Key Observations:**  
✔ **Partition Count:** `3` means the topic has three partitions.  
✔ **Replication Factor:** `1` indicates no fault tolerance (single copy per partition).  
✔ **ISR (In-Sync Replicas):** `0` might indicate an issue if brokers aren’t correctly configured.  

---

### ❌ **Deleting a Topic**  
```bash
kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic second_topic --delete
```
✔ **Removes the topic named `second_topic`** 📜  

⚠ **Important:** Kafka **topic deletion depends on the broker configuration** (`delete.topic.enable=true` must be set in `server.properties`).  

---

### 📩 **Using Kafka Console Producer**  

✔ **Start a Producer & Send Messages**  
```bash
kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic
```
💬 **Example Messages:**  
```
>Hello Priyanka
>It's a good day..!!
>How are you?
>I am good here.
>^C
```
✅ **Messages are sent asynchronously** to `first_topic`.  

✔ **Using Acknowledgment Mode (`acks=all`)**  
```bash
kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --producer-property acks=all
```
💡 **What happens?**  
- Ensures messages are **fully committed** across all in-sync replicas before acknowledging.  
- Improves **reliability** at the cost of **higher latency**.  

---

### 🛑 **Using Kafka Console Consumer**  

✔ **Start Consumer & Read Messages**  
```bash
kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic
```
❌ **Issue:** Nothing happens!  

📌 **Possible Reasons:**  
1️⃣ **No messages available** in the topic.  
2️⃣ **Consumer offset starts from latest messages (empty buffer)**  
3️⃣ **Kafka server may not be running correctly**  

✔ **Fix: Read Messages From Beginning**  
```bash
kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --from-beginning
```

---

### 🎯 **Key Takeaways**  
✔ **Kafka topics can be described & deleted using `kafka-topics.sh`** 🔍  
✔ **Console Producer sends messages asynchronously** 📩  
✔ **`acks=all` ensures message delivery reliability** ✅  
✔ **Consumer needs `--from-beginning` to retrieve historical messages** 📜  

---

Messages in Kafka **do not guarantee strict sequential order** when consumed. Here’s why:  

🔹 **Kafka Uses Multiple Partitions** 📦  
- Messages are **distributed** across partitions based on a partitioning key (or randomly if not specified).  
- When consuming, messages may come **from multiple partitions in parallel**, leading to seemingly **random order**.  

🔹 **Consumer Fetching Behavior** 🎯  
- The consumer **fetches from multiple partitions simultaneously**, so message retrieval **depends on partition offsets** rather than strict timestamp order.  
- This is why messages may appear out of sequence when displayed.  

🔹 **Broker & Replication Factors** ⚙  
- Messages are **stored & replicated** across brokers, and the consumer may fetch messages from different replicas.  
- This replication process does not enforce an exact sequence globally.  

✅ **How to Read Messages in Strict Order?**  
- **Use a Single Partition** (force all messages into one partition).  
  ```bash
  kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic first_topic --create --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
  ```
- **Assign a Consumer to a Specific Partition**  
  ```bash
  kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --partition 0 --from-beginning
  ```
---

### 🚀 **Kafka Consumer Group Implementation**  

---

### 🏗 **Launching a Consumer Group**  

📌 **Overview:**  
✔ A **topic** (`first_topic`) with **3 partitions**  
✔ **Producer sends messages** to the topic  
✔ Multiple **consumers** join the same **consumer group** (`my-first-application`)  
✔ Kafka distributes messages **in round-robin fashion**  

---

### 🎯 **Step 1: Start Consumer Group (`Consumer 1`)**  
```bash
kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --group my-first-application
```
✅ **Joins Consumer Group: `my-first-application`**  

✔ Consumer listens for new messages.  
✔ Producer sends **M1**, **M2**, **M3** messages.  
✔ Messages are **distributed across partitions**.

---

### 🛠 **Step 2: Start Producer & Send Messages**  
```bash
kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic
```
💡 **Producer creates messages:**  
```
>M1
>M2
>M3
>^C
```
✔ These **3 messages get distributed across 3 partitions** 🎯  

---

### 🔄 **Step 3: Scaling Consumer Group (`Consumer 2`)**  
```bash
kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --group my-first-application
```
✔ **Second consumer joins the group**  
✔ **Workload is shared** between multiple consumers  
✔ More messages sent by producer **are consumed by both consumers**

### 🚀 **Step 4: Adding More Consumers**  
📌 Launch `Consumer 3`  
```bash
kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --group my-first-application
```
📌 Launch `Consumer 4`  
```bash
kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --group my-first-application
```
✔ Each **consumer picks messages in a distributed fashion**  

📌 **Example Message Flow:**  
- **M8 → Consumer 3**  
- **M9 → Consumer 2**  
- **M10 → Consumer 1**  
- **M11 → Consumer 4**  
- **M12 → Consumer 3**

### ⚠ **Consumer Failure Handling**  
📌 **Crashing Consumer 4**  
✔ **M17 → Consumer 3**  
✔ **M18 → Consumer 2**  
✔ **M19 → Consumer 1**  

💡 **Kafka automatically redistributes partition ownership** when a consumer crashes, ensuring no message loss.

### 🎯 **Key Takeaways**  
✔ **Consumer groups allow load balancing** across multiple consumers ✅  
✔ **Messages are distributed across partitions** in round-robin fashion 🔄  
✔ **If a consumer crashes, Kafka redistributes its partitions** 🚀  
✔ **Offsets are committed automatically to track consumption state** 🎯
