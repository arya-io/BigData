## Introduction
Apache HBase is a database that runs on a Hadoop cluster. 
HBase is not a traditional RDBMS
Data stored in HBase also does not need to fit into a rigid schema like with an RDBMS
HBase allows you to build big data applications for scaling, with low latency

## Relational Databases vs. HBase – Data 
Storage Model
 Why do we need NoSQL/HBase? 
 First, let’s look at the pros of relational databases before 
we discuss its limitations:
   Relational databases have provided a standard persistence model
   SQL has become a de-facto standard model of data manipulation
   Relational databases manage concurrency for transactions
   Relational database have lots of tools

📌 **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram in Databases** 📊  

An **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram** visually represents the relationships between different **entities (tables)** in a database, helping us understand data structure and interactions. Let’s break it down in simple terms! 😊  

---

### 🔍 **Understanding ER Diagrams**  
An ER diagram consists of:  
✅ **Entities (Tables)** → Represent real-world objects like Customers, Orders, and Products.  
✅ **Attributes (Columns)** → Describe the properties of entities (e.g., `Name`, `Quantity`).  
✅ **Relationships** → Show how tables connect via keys (`customer_id`, `product_id`).  

Think of an ER diagram like **a map of a database**, helping us visualize how data flows and interacts! 🚀  

---

### 🖥️ **ER Diagram Breakdown**  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/543e7f86-57ee-46e9-b591-601a172ca6e6)

ER diagram consists of **four key tables**:  

1️⃣ **Customer Table** 🏠  
   - `ID` (Primary Key) 🔑  
   - `Name` (Customer’s name) 📝  
   - `PhoneNo` (Contact number) 📞  

2️⃣ **Order Table** 📦  
   - `ID` (Primary Key) 🔑  
   - `customer_id` (Foreign Key 🔗 → Links to `Customer.ID`)  

3️⃣ **OrderItem Table** 🛒  
   - `ID` (Primary Key) 🔑  
   - `Order_ID` (Foreign Key 🔗 → Links to `Order.ID`)  
   - `Product_ID` (Foreign Key 🔗 → Links to `Product.ID`)  
   - `Quantity` (Number of items purchased) 🔢  

4️⃣ **Product Table** 🏷️  
   - `ID` (Primary Key) 🔑  
   - `Name` (Product name) 📝  
   - `Description` (Product details) 📜  

---

### 📷 **Visual Representation of Relationships**  
Your image beautifully illustrates the relationships:  
✅ A **Customer can place multiple Orders** (`customer_id` links `Customer` to `Order`).  
✅ **Each Order can contain multiple products** (`OrderItem` stores product purchases).  
✅ **Products exist independently**, but they are linked to Orders through `OrderItem`.  

---

### 🎯 **Why ER Diagrams Are Important?**  
✅ Helps in designing a **structured and organized database** 🔄  
✅ Improves **data integrity** by defining clear relationships 📊  
✅ Essential for understanding how queries interact with tables 🚀  

## Relational Databases vs. HBase – Data 
Storage Model
 so what changed? 
 With more and more data came the need to scale. 
 One way to scale is vertically with a bigger server, but this 
can get expensive, and there are limits as your data size 
increases.
RDBMS is an example of vertical scalability.

## What changed to bring on NoSQL?
 An alternative to vertical scaling is to scale horizontally 
with a cluster of machines, which can use commodity 
hardware. 
 This can be cheaper and more reliable.
 To horizontally partition or shard a RDBMS, data is 
distributed on the basis of rows, with some rows residing 
on a single machine and the other rows residing on other 
machines
Partitioning of the table is also known as sharding.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8886b0ac-5cd1-40f5-8e4a-007a0f39d199)

## What changed to bring on NoSQL?
 There are Limitations of a Relational Model
 Database normalization eliminates redundant data, which makes 
storage efficient. However, a normalized schema causes joins for 
queries, in order to bring the data back together again.
 While HBase does not support relationships and joins, 
data that is accessed together is stored together so it 
avoids the limitations associated with a relational model

📌 **Comparing Storage Models: RDBMS vs. HBase** 🏛️  

Understanding how different databases **store and access data** is crucial for choosing the right storage model. Let’s break it down in simple terms! 😊  

---

### 🔍 **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**  
RDBMS stores data **in structured tables** with rows and columns. It supports **transactions and joins**, but these **do not scale efficiently** in large distributed systems.  

❌ **Challenges:**  
- **Joins require combining tables** across nodes, creating a **bottleneck**. 🔄  
- **Transactional operations** slow down processing when dealing with massive data volumes.  

---

### 🏗️ **HBase (NoSQL Columnar Storage)**  
HBase takes a different approach:  
✅ **Data that is accessed together is stored together**, reducing unnecessary joins.  
✅ Uses **column-oriented storage**, making retrieval faster for large datasets.  

📜 **Example of Efficient Data Retrieval in HBase:**  
Imagine storing **user activity logs** where each user frequently accesses related data. Instead of spreading records across multiple tables (as RDBMS does), **HBase keeps related data grouped** for faster access.  

---

### 📷 **Visual Representation**    
- **RDBMS** experiences a **bottleneck** when handling distributed joins and transactions.  
- **HBase** optimizes storage by **keeping accessed data together**, ensuring smoother scalability.  

---

### 🎯 **Key Takeaways**  
✅ **RDBMS is structured & transactional**, but struggles at scale 📊  
✅ **HBase is optimized for big data**, storing related data together 🔄  
✅ Ideal for **high-speed reads/writes and large-scale data processing** 🚀  

## Distribution, Scale, and Speed
 HBase was designed to scale due to the fact that data 
that is accessed together is stored together.  Grouping the data by key is central to running on a cluster. 
 In horizontal partitioning or sharding, the key range is 
used for sharding, which distributes different data across 
multiple servers. 
 Each server is the source for a subset of data.

---

## Distribution, Scale, and Speed
 HBase is referred to as a column family-oriented data 
store. 
 It’s also row-oriented: each row is indexed by a key that 
you can use for lookup (for example, lookup a customer 
with the ID of 1234). 
 Each column family groups like data (customer address, 
order) within rows. 
 Think of a row as the join of all values in all column 
families.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b97b47ba-5a42-449f-946a-2430fddb4a3a)

Data is accessed and stored together:
Rowkey is the primary index
Column Families group similar data by row key

## Distribution, Scale, and Speed
 HBase is also considered a distributed database. 
 Grouping the data by key is central to running on a cluster 
and sharding. 
 The key acts as the atomic unit for updates.
Atomic: Atom is the smallest piece/unit which cannot be broken

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96b97a57-3015-4820-8ff7-aef1a65c6466)

Put, Get by Key
Data is automatically distributed across the cluster
Key range is used for horizontal partitioning

## HBase Data Model

 Data stored in HBase is located by its rowkey
 This is like a primary key from a relational database. 
 Records in HBase are stored in sorted order, according to 
rowkey

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3b13356-4a38-481b-bf86-d094d767fb92)

## Data Model
 Tables are divided into sequences of rows, by key range, 
called regions.  These regions are then assigned to the data nodes in the 
cluster called RegionServers.
 This scales read and write capacity by spreading regions 
across the cluster. 
 This is done automatically and is how HBase was designed 
for horizontal sharding.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5680df30-a5d0-41dc-aa51-43e94e6ef406)

Tables are partitioned into key ranges(regions)
Region = served by nodes (Region Servers)
Regions are spread across cluster

## Data Model
 column families are mapped to storage files.

Column families are stored in separate files.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcb23c82-8a6d-4316-9649-5892d411003c)

## Data Model
 The data is stored in HBase table cells. 
 The entire cell, with the added structural information, is 
called Key Value.  The entire cell, the row key, column family name, column 
name, timestamp, and value are stored for every cell for 
which you have set a value.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ef640ef-778f-447b-93cf-e8db13a1fc24)

## Data Model
Logically, cells are stored in a table format, but 
physically, rows are stored as linear sets of cells 
containing all the key value information inside them.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91245a0c-b404-4920-bd44-97bb1dba8574)

## Sparse data with cell versions
 The complete coordinates to a cell's value are: 
Table:Row:Family:Column:Timestamp ➔ Value. 
 HBase tables are sparsely populated. If data doesn’t exist 
at a column, it’s not stored. 
 Table cells are versioned uninterpreted arrays of bytes. 
 You can use the timestamp or set up your own versioning 
system. 
 For every coordinate row:family:column, there can be 
multiple versions of the value.

## Sparse data with cell versions
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c32b92b6-b534-46b8-82fc-4751e8324720)

## Sparse data with cell versions
 A put is both an insert (create) and an update, and each 
one gets its own version. 
 Delete gets a tombstone marker. The tombstone marker 
prevents the data being returned in queries. 
 Get requests return specific version(s) based on 
parameters. If you do not specify any parameters, the 
most recent version is returned. 
 You can configure how many versions you want to keep 
and this is done per column family.

## Sparse data with cell versions

Number of versions can be configured. Default number equal to 1

## HBase Architectural Components
 Physically, HBase is composed of three types of servers in 
a master slave type of architecture. 
 Region servers serve data for reads and writes. When accessing 
data, clients communicate with HBase Region Servers directly.
 Region assignment, DDL (create, delete tables) operations are 
handled by the HBase Master process. 
 Zookeeper, which is part of HDFS, maintains a live cluster state.

## HBase Architectural Components
 The Hadoop DataNode stores the data that the Region 
Server is managing. 
 All HBase data is stored in HDFS files. Region Servers are 
collocated with the HDFS DataNodes, which enable data 
locality (putting the data close to where it is needed) for 
the data served by the RegionServers. 
 HBase data is local when it is written, but when a region is 
moved, it is not local until compaction.
 The NameNode maintains metadata information for all 
the physical data blocks that comprise the files.

📌 **HBase Architectural Components** 🏢  

HBase is a **distributed, scalable, NoSQL database** designed to handle large datasets efficiently. Understanding its architecture helps optimize performance and data management. Let’s break it down! 😊  

---

### 🏗️ **Key Components of HBase Architecture**  
HBase consists of several core components that work together to store and process data effectively.  

#### 🔹 **HBase Master** (Coordinator) 🏢  
- Manages **region assignments** across RegionServers.  
- Handles **schema changes** like creating tables or modifying column families.  
- Ensures **failover and balancing** of regions between RegionServers.  

#### 🔹 **RegionServer** (Worker Nodes) ⚙️  
- Stores **actual data** in the form of **regions** (subsets of tables).  
- Processes **read and write requests** efficiently.  
- Manages **compactions and splits** to optimize performance.  

#### 🔹 **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)** 📂  
- Acts as the **underlying storage** for HBase tables.  
- Stores **HFiles**, which contain persistent data in column-family format.  

#### 🔹 **ZooKeeper** 🦓  
- Helps **coordinate** between HBase components.  
- Keeps track of **leader election and failure handling**.  
- Ensures **synchronization** between Master and RegionServers.  

---

### 🖥️ **How Components Work Together**  
1️⃣ **Client sends a request** (Read or Write) to HBase.  
2️⃣ **HBase Master assigns regions** to appropriate RegionServers.  
3️⃣ **RegionServer processes the request** and stores/retrieves data from HDFS.  
4️⃣ **ZooKeeper ensures coordination** and failure handling across nodes.  

📜 **Example Query Handling Process:**  
When querying HBase, the client locates the RegionServer responsible for the row key using the **META table** and retrieves the result efficiently.  

---

### 📷 **Visual Representation**  
Your image clearly illustrates how HBase components interact:  
✅ The **HBase Master coordinates regions** among RegionServers.  
✅ **RegionServers store data** and serve queries efficiently.  
✅ **HDFS provides underlying storage**, ensuring fault tolerance.  
✅ **ZooKeeper manages synchronization**, ensuring smooth operations.  

---

### 🎯 **Why HBase Architecture Is Powerful?**  
✅ **Handles massive-scale data** efficiently 🚀  
✅ **Distributed and fault-tolerant**, ensuring high availability 🌐  
✅ **Optimized for real-time access**, unlike traditional databases ⚡  


## Regions

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e59a09f6-5720-4d3b-a3cc-952b45c1ea9b)

 HBase Tables are divided horizontally by row key range 
into Regions.  A region contains all rows in the table between the 
region’s start key and end key. 
 Regions are assigned to the nodes in the cluster, called 
Region Servers, and these serve data for reads and 
writes. 
 A region server can serve about 1,000 regions.

📌 **Understanding HBase Regions** 🏢  

HBase is a **distributed, column-oriented database** that splits data into **regions** to enable efficient scaling and performance. Let’s break it down in simple terms! 😊  

---

### 🔍 **What Is an HBase Region?**  
An **HBase region** is the **smallest unit of data distribution** in HBase. It contains a subset of a table’s rows and **spreads the workload** across multiple nodes in the cluster.  

Think of an **HBase table** as a **large book** 📖. Instead of storing it as a single massive volume, it is **split into chapters (regions)** to make access and retrieval faster! 🚀  

---

### 🏗️ **How HBase Regions Work**  
1️⃣ When a **table is created**, it starts with a **single region**.  
2️⃣ As data grows, regions **split automatically** to **distribute workload** across nodes.  
3️⃣ The **HBase RegionServer** manages multiple regions and handles **read/write requests** efficiently.  

📜 **Example: When Data Expands**
- If your table starts with **1 million rows**, it may have **one region** initially.  
- If the row count grows to **10 million**, HBase **splits the region into multiple smaller regions** to **balance the load** across nodes.  

---

### 📷 **Visual Representation**  
Your image illustrates this concept beautifully:  
- **A large dataset is divided into multiple regions** for better performance.  
- Each **RegionServer manages multiple regions**, ensuring scalability.  
- **Regions split dynamically** as more data is added.  

---

### 🎯 **Why HBase Uses Regions?**  
✅ **Improves scalability** → Data is distributed dynamically 🚀  
✅ **Enhances performance** → No single node handles too much data 🔄  
✅ **Supports automatic load balancing** → Regions split as needed ⚡  

##📌 **Understanding HBase HMaster** 🏢  

The **HMaster** is the **central controller** in an HBase cluster, responsible for managing regions, coordinating RegionServers, and handling administrative tasks. Let’s break it down in simple terms! 😊  

---

### 🔍 **Role of HMaster in HBase**

### 🎯 **Why HMaster Is Important?**  
✅ **Centralized management** ensures smooth operations 🌐  
✅ **Automatically balances workloads** across RegionServers 🚀  
✅ **Prevents downtime** by handling recovery and failovers efficiently 🔄  

## 📌 **ZooKeeper: The Coordinator in HBase** 🦓  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa9a2ac0-6d1a-4caa-b5bd-918417ba6b17)

ZooKeeper plays a **critical role** in HBase by acting as a **distributed coordination service**, ensuring that server states are monitored and managed efficiently. Let’s break it down in simple terms! 😊  

---

### 🔍 **What is ZooKeeper in HBase?**  
ZooKeeper is a **centralized service** that helps maintain the state of the **HBase cluster** by tracking active RegionServers and handling **failures dynamically**.  

Think of it like **a traffic controller** 🚦 that ensures smooth communication between different components of HBase, preventing bottlenecks!  

---

### 🏗️ **Key Responsibilities of ZooKeeper**  

✅ **Maintains Cluster State** 🌐 → Tracks which RegionServers are alive and available.  
✅ **Failure Detection & Recovery** 🔄 → Provides **server failure notifications** to HMaster, allowing automatic region reassignments.  
✅ **Ensures Synchronization** ⚙️ → Keeps multiple nodes coordinated to avoid conflicts in distributed processing.  

---

### 🖥️ **How ZooKeeper Works in HBase**  
1️⃣ **Each RegionServer registers itself** with ZooKeeper upon startup.  
2️⃣ **ZooKeeper continuously monitors RegionServers**, checking their health.  
3️⃣ If a **RegionServer fails**, ZooKeeper **notifies the HMaster** to reassign regions automatically.  

📜 **Example Process:**  
If a RegionServer handling a customer database **goes offline**, ZooKeeper **alerts HMaster**, which then **moves customer data handling to a healthy RegionServer**—ensuring seamless operations! 🚀  

---

### 📷 **Visual Representation**

### 🔍 **ZooKeeper: The Coordinator** 🦓  
- **Maintains shared state information** for distributed systems.  
- Ensures that RegionServers and the active **HMaster** are properly synchronized.  
- Provides **server failure notifications**, allowing automatic recovery.  

---

### 🏗️ **Interaction Between Components**  

#### 🔹 **RegionServers & HMaster Communication**  
✅ **Each RegionServer connects to ZooKeeper** during startup.  
✅ **The active HMaster maintains a session with ZooKeeper** to monitor cluster health.  
✅ **ZooKeeper tracks which RegionServers are alive**, ensuring efficient load balancing.  

#### 🔹 **Ephemeral Nodes & Heartbeats** 🏥  
✅ **ZooKeeper uses ephemeral nodes** to store active session details.  
✅ These nodes exist **only while the RegionServer/HMaster is connected**.  
✅ **Heartbeats are sent at regular intervals** to confirm that servers are running.  
✅ If a RegionServer **fails to send a heartbeat**, ZooKeeper **removes its ephemeral node** and alerts HMaster for region reassignment.  

📜 **Example:**  
Imagine **three RegionServers** actively handling data requests. If one **fails**, ZooKeeper **detects the missing heartbeat**, removes its session node, and **notifies HMaster** to redistribute its regions—ensuring no downtime! 🚀  

---

✅ **Supports dynamic scaling**, making HBase ideal for big data applications 🚀  

## 📌 **HBase First Read or Write Process** 🏢  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5eb2700-d920-4ff6-aefd-727524f92619)

When performing a **read or write** operation in HBase, the system first checks the **META table** to locate the correct region where the data resides. Let’s break this process down in simple terms! 😊  

---

### 🔍 **Understanding the META Table**  
✅ The **META table** acts as an **index**, storing information about **regions and their locations**.  
✅ It helps **HBase clients find the correct RegionServer** when accessing data.  

💡 **Think of it like a GPS system** 🗺️—when you request data, HBase **first checks the META table** to know where to retrieve the information.  

---

### 🏗️ **Role of ZooKeeper in Locating the META Table**  
✅ **ZooKeeper stores the location of the META table**, ensuring efficient coordination.  
✅ If a RegionServer fails or moves, ZooKeeper **updates the META table’s location**, helping HMaster redistribute regions dynamically.  

📜 **Example Process:**
1️⃣ **Client sends a request** to read or write data.  
2️⃣ **HBase checks ZooKeeper** to locate the META table.  
3️⃣ **META table provides the correct RegionServer** handling that row key.  
4️⃣ **RegionServer retrieves or writes data** efficiently.  

🚀 **This ensures fast lookups, reducing unnecessary delays in large-scale distributed databases!**

📌 **Region Server Components in HBase** 🏢  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51257acf-46f8-4d6a-b29b-3d9f45a06cad)


A **RegionServer** runs on an **HDFS data node** and is responsible for **storing and processing data** in HBase. It contains several key components that help optimize performance and reliability. Let’s break them down! 😊  

---

### 🏗️ **Key Components of a RegionServer**  

#### 🔹 **WAL (Write-Ahead Log)** 📝  
✅ Acts as a **temporary storage** for new data that has **not yet been permanently written to disk**.  
✅ Ensures **data recovery** in case of failure.  
✅ Logs all modifications before persisting them to **HFiles** in HDFS.  

💡 **Think of WAL like an autosave feature** 📜—if the system crashes, it can restore the latest changes!  

---

#### 🔹 **BlockCache (Read Cache)** ⚡  
✅ Stores **frequently accessed data** in memory to reduce disk reads.  
✅ **Uses an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy**—older, less-used data is removed when full.  
✅ Speeds up read operations by **retrieving commonly accessed rows quickly**.  

💡 **Think of BlockCache like a browser cache**—loading frequently accessed pages faster! 🚀  

---

#### 🔹 **MemStore (Write Cache)** 🏗️  
✅ Temporarily stores **new writes before flushing them to disk**.  
✅ Maintains data in **sorted order** for efficient writes.  
✅ Each **column family** has its own **MemStore** per region.  

💡 **Think of MemStore as a waiting area**—data is collected, sorted, and then committed to disk for optimization!  

---

#### 🔹 **HFiles (Persistent Storage)** 📂  
✅ Stores **rows as sorted KeyValues** permanently on disk.
