# 📊 The Three V's of Big Data  
Big Data is characterized by three main factors:  

- **📦 Volume:** The size of the data (huge amounts of information collected from various sources).  
- **🌍 Variety:** The different formats and types of data (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured).  
- **⚡ Velocity:** The speed at which data is generated, processed, and analyzed.  

💡 *Example:* Think of social media—millions of users generate posts, comments, and messages every second. This enormous, fast-moving, and diverse data is classic Big Data!

# 🖥️ Big Data Concepts & Terminology  

- **🖥️ Clustered Computing:** Using multiple machines together to form a powerful system.  
- **🔄 Parallel Computing:** Performing computations simultaneously to speed up processing.  
- **🌐 Distributed Computing:** Multiple networked computers work together, sharing the workload.  
- **📦 Batch Processing:** Dividing large jobs into smaller chunks and running them separately.  
- **⚡ Real-Time Processing:** Handling data instantly as it arrives (e.g., stock market updates).  

💡 *Example:* Online transactions—when you make a purchase, the system instantly processes payment details, checks availability, and confirms your order.

# ⚙️ Big Data Processing Systems  

### 🔹 Hadoop/MapReduce  
- ✔️ A scalable, fault-tolerant framework written in Java.  
- 🔓 Open-source, widely used in Big Data.  
- ⏳ Primarily supports batch processing (processing data in chunks).  

### ⚡ Apache Spark  
- 🚀 A high-speed, general-purpose cluster computing system.  
- 🔓 Open-source, like Hadoop.  
- 🏎️ Supports both batch and real-time data processing, making it more versatile.  

💡 *Comparison:* Hadoop works like a traditional assembly line, processing one batch at a time. Spark, on the other hand, processes data much faster and supports real-time tasks!

# 🔥 Apache Spark Components  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a5d8342-4251-45ce-9efc-12f3563b7965)  

Apache Spark consists of several components that enhance its functionality:  

- **🗂️ Spark SQL** – Used for structured data processing, similar to SQL databases.  
- **🤖 MLlib (Machine Learning Library)** – Provides algorithms for machine learning tasks like classification, clustering, and regression.  
- **🔗 GraphX** – Optimized for graph-based computations and analytics (think social network connections).  
- **🌊 Spark Streaming** – Handles real-time data processing, such as analyzing live tweets or stock prices.  
- **⚡ RDD API (Resilient Distributed Dataset)** – The core data model of Spark, just like:  
  - Tables in Hive  
  - Relations in Pig  
  - DataFrames in Pandas  

💡 *Example:* If you’ve ever worked with Pandas in Python, RDDs are somewhat similar—they provide a flexible way to process data across multiple machines!  

---

# 🚀 Spark Modes of Deployment  

Spark can run in different modes depending on the environment:  

- **💻 Local Mode** – Runs on a single machine, like your laptop.  
  - ✅ Best for testing, debugging, and small-scale experiments.  
  - ✅ Convenient for learning and demonstrations.  

- **🌐 Cluster Mode** – Runs on a group of predefined machines in a distributed setup.  
  - ✅ Used for production environments.  
  - ✅ Handles large-scale data efficiently.  

🔄 **Workflow:**  
Development starts on **Local Mode**, and then moves to **Cluster Mode** for production—without requiring any code changes!  

💡 *Example:* Think of Local Mode as using your laptop for practice, while Cluster Mode is like deploying an app on powerful servers for real-world users.  

---

# 🐍 PySpark  

## 🚀 PySpark: Spark with Python  

Apache Spark is originally written in Scala, but to enable Python developers to use Spark, the community introduced **PySpark**!  

### ⚡ Features of PySpark:  
- ✅ Provides the same **speed** and **power** as Scala-based Spark.  
- ✅ PySpark APIs are **similar to Pandas and Scikit-learn**, making it beginner-friendly.  

💡 *Example:* If you already use Pandas for data analysis, switching to PySpark for big data tasks will feel natural!

# 🏗️ What is Spark Shell?  

Spark Shell is an interactive environment where you can quickly execute Spark jobs. It helps in:  

✔️ **Fast prototyping** – Quickly testing whether something works or not.  
✔️ **Interacting with data** – Directly working with files on disk or data in memory.  

### 🖥️ Types of Spark Shells:  
- 🟠 **Spark-shell** for Scala  
- 🔵 **PySpark-shell** for Python  
- 🟢 **SparkR** for R  

🔹 Spark can also run in **Java**, but there is **no dedicated shell for Java**.  

💡 *Example:* Think of Spark Shell as a Python REPL (interactive prompt), but for big data processing—it allows you to run small code snippets and experiment with Spark's capabilities without setting up full programs!  

---

# 🛠️ Opening Python Shell Using PySpark  

You can open the **Python shell using PySpark** instead of Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal:  

```bash
pyspark
```

This will launch the PySpark interactive shell, allowing you to run Spark commands directly.  

💡 *Example:* If you're familiar with Python's interactive prompt (`python` command in the terminal), PySpark works similarly but with Spark-based functions included!  

---

To run **PySpark** in the **Python shell** instead of launching Jupyter Notebook, you need to unset certain configurations. Here’s how you can do it:  

### 🛠️ Steps to Unset the Configuration & Use Python Shell  

1️⃣ **Unset the `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS` environment variables**  
Run the following command in your terminal:  

```bash
unset PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON
unset PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON_OPTS
```

🔹 These environment variables are responsible for launching Jupyter Notebook by default when you run `pyspark`.  

2️⃣ **Run PySpark in the Terminal**  
Once the configurations are unset, simply enter:  

```bash
pyspark
```

✔️ This will now open the **PySpark interactive shell**, instead of Jupyter Notebook.  

💡 *Example:* Think of this like switching from a **fancy graphical interface (Jupyter)** to a **raw terminal experience**, where you can directly run Python commands with Spark.

## Understanding SparkContext

SparkContext is an entry point into the world of Spark
An entry point is away of connecting to Sparkcluster
An entry point is like a key to the house
PySpark has adefault SparkContext called sc
A SparkContext represents the entry point to Spark functionality. It's like a key to your car. PySpark automatically creates a SparkContext for you in the PySpark shell (so you don't have to create it by yourself) and is exposed via a variable sc.

# script.py

# Print the version of SparkContext
print("The version of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is", sc.version)

# Print the Python version of SparkContext
print("The Python version of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is", sc.pythonVer)

# Print the master of SparkContext
print("The master of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is", sc.master)

The version of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is 2.4.5
The Python version of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is 3.6
The master of Spark Context in the PySpark shell is local[*]


## Inspecting Spark Context

## Loading data in PySpark

SparkContext's parallelize() method
rdd = sc.parallelize([1,2,3,4,5])

SparkContext's textFile() method
rdd2 = sc.textFile("test.txt")

File Protocol

jupyter notebook is not a spark shell
read evaluate print loop (REPL) is same as Spark Shell

## Interactive Use of PySpark

    Spark comes with an interactive python shell in which PySpark is already installed in it. PySpark shell is useful for basic testing and debugging and it is quite powerful. The easiest way to demonstrate the power of PySpark’s shell is to start using it.
    The most important thing to understand here is that we are not creating any SparkContext object because PySpark automatically creates the SparkContext object named sc, by default in the PySpark shell.

    # Create a python list of numbers from 1 to 100 
numb = range(1,101)
print(type(numb))

# Load the list into PySpark  
spark_data = sc.parallelize(numb)
print(type(spark_data))

# spark_data.collect()
print(spark_data.collect())

help(spark_data.collect())

## Loading data in PySpark shell

    In PySpark, we express our computation through operations on distributed collections that are automatically parallelized across the cluster.

    file_path = 'file:////home/talentum/spark/README.md'
# Load a local file into PySpark shell
lines = sc.textFile(file_path)
print(lines.take(5))

file_path = 'file:////home/talentum/spark/README.md'

# Load a local file into PySpark shell

lines = sc.textFile(file_path)

print(lines.take(5))

['# Apache Spark', '', 'Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides', 'high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that', 'supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a']

print(type(lines.take))
print(type(lines.take(5)))

<class 'method'>
<class 'list'>

lines.first()

'We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect 

type(lines.first())
str

In Rdd, every line is known as an element.

# Use of Lambda function in python filter()

## What are anonymous functions in Python?
Lambda functions are anonymous functions in Python
Very powerful and used in Python. Quite effcient with map() and filter()
Lambda functions create functions to be called later similar to def
It returns the functions without any name (i.e anonymous)
Inline a function definition or to defer execution of acode

---

## Lambda function syntax
The general form of lambda functions is
lambda arguments: expression
Example of lambda function
double = lambda x: x * 2 
print(double(3))

---

## Difference between def vs lambda functions
Python code to illustrate cube of anumber
def cube(x):
return x ** 3
g = lambda x: x ** 3
print(g(10)) 
print(cube(10))
1000
1000

No return statement for lambda
Can put lambda function anywhere

---

## Use of Lambda function in python - map()
map() function takes a function and a list and returns a new list which contains items returned by that function for each item

General syntax of map()
map(function, list)

Example ofmap()

items = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
list(map(lambda x: x + 2 , items))

[3, 4, 5, 6]

The type of map is a Map Object.

The same functionality can be implemented using for loop. But that approach is verbose. So, in order to eliminate the verbosity, map function comes into picture.

---

## Use of Lambda function in python - filter()
filter() function takes a function and a list and returns a new list for which the function evaluates as true

General syntax of filter():
filter(function, list)

Example of filter()
items = [1, 2, 3, 4]
list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 != 0), items))

[1, 3]

Lambda Function is not a feature of Spark
