# 🐝 About Hive – Continued  

### 🏢 **Hive as a Data Warehouse System**  
Hive is a **data warehouse** solution built on top of **Hadoop**, designed to process and manage large-scale structured data efficiently. Think of it as a tool that **organizes and queries massive datasets** just like a traditional SQL-based database.  

### 📂 **Metadata Management**  
Hive **maintains metadata** (information about data structure) for your **big data stored in HDFS**. This metadata includes details about:
- **Table names**
- **Column types**
- **Data locations**  
Just like how a library catalog keeps track of book locations, Hive keeps track of where different pieces of data reside in Hadoop’s ecosystem.  

### 📊 **Big Data as Tables**  
Even though Hadoop stores data in files and directories, Hive **abstracts** that data into **tables**, making it easier to work with. You can think of Hive like a translator—it converts raw distributed data into a table-like format, allowing users to perform **structured queries** just as they would in a traditional database.  

### 📝 **SQL-like Operations with HiveQL**  
Hive uses **HiveQL**, a special query language that is **similar to SQL**. This means users can write queries almost the same way they would in a **relational database**, making it easy for beginners who are already familiar with SQL concepts.  
For example:  

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM employees WHERE age > 30;
```  

This HiveQL query selects employee names and ages where the age is greater than 30—just like in SQL!

# 🔄 Hive's Alignment with SQL  

### 🗂️ **SQL Datatypes in Hive**  
Hive supports a variety of **SQL-like datatypes**, making it easier for users familiar with SQL to work with Hive seamlessly. Here’s a comparison of common SQL datatypes used in Hive:  

| **SQL Datatype**  | **Equivalent in Hive** |
|------------------|---------------------|
| INT | Integer values |
| TINYINT / SMALLINT / BIGINT | Different sizes of integer values |
| BOOLEAN | True/False values |
| FLOAT / DOUBLE | Decimal numbers |
| STRING / BINARY | Text and binary data |
| TIMESTAMP | Date and time values |
| ARRAY / MAP / STRUCT / UNION | Complex data types |
| DECIMAL | Precision-based decimal values |
| CHAR / VARCHAR | Fixed-length and variable-length text |
| DATE | Stores only date information |

👉 **Example:**  
```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
    id INT,
    name STRING,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    joining_date DATE
);
```
This Hive table definition follows SQL-like structure, making it intuitive for SQL users!  

---

### ⚙️ **SQL Semantics in Hive**  
Hive also supports **SQL-like semantics**, allowing users to write queries in a familiar format. Here are some key **SQL operations** that work in Hive:  

✔ **Basic Queries**  
- `SELECT` – Fetch data from tables  
- `LOAD` – Import external data into Hive  
- `INSERT` – Insert new records into tables  

✔ **Filtering & Grouping**  
- `WHERE` / `HAVING` – Apply conditions on queries  
- `GROUP BY` – Group data based on specific columns  
- `ORDER BY` / `SORT BY` – Arrange data in a specific order  

✔ **Advanced Querying**  
- `JOIN` (LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, CROSS JOIN) – Combine data from multiple tables  
- `CLUSTER BY` / `DISTRIBUTE BY` – Efficiently distribute data in Hive  
- `SUBQUERIES` – Use queries inside queries (`IN`, `EXISTS`)  
- `WINDOWING FUNCTIONS` (`RANK`, `OVER()`) – Perform analytical operations  

👉 **Example:**  
```sql
SELECT name, salary FROM employee WHERE salary > 50000 ORDER BY salary DESC;
```
This query fetches employee names with salaries above 50,000, sorted in descending order—exactly like SQL!

### 🏗️ **What is Hive?**  
Apache Hive is a **data warehouse system** built on top of **Hadoop**. It is used to store, manage, and query large datasets using a **SQL-like language called HiveQL**. Instead of manually writing complex **MapReduce** programs, Hive simplifies big data analysis with structured queries.  

### 🔍 **How Hive Works**  
When you execute a query in Hive:  
1. You submit an **SQL-like query** using **HiveQL**.  
2. Hive translates it into a **MapReduce job** that runs on **Hadoop**.  
3. The result is processed and returned to the user in **tabular form**, just like a traditional database system.  

### 🛠️ **Hive Components**  
Hive works through several core components:  

| **Component** | **Function** |
|--------------|-------------|
| **HiveServer2** | Manages query execution and client requests |
| **Metastore** | Stores metadata (table structures, partitions, data locations) |
| **Compiler & Optimizer** | Converts queries into execution plans |
| **Executor** | Runs queries by translating them into Hadoop tasks |

### 📷 **Visual Representation**  
The image you uploaded illustrates **Hive's workflow**, showing how queries move through different components before executing as **MapReduce jobs** on Hadoop. It highlights the interactions between **HiveServer2, Metastore, Hadoop YARN, and the query optimization process**.

# 📝 **Submitting Hive Queries**  

### 🖥️ **Hive CLI (Command Line Interface)**  
The **Hive CLI** is the **traditional way** to interact with Hive. It functions as a **thick client**, meaning it connects directly to the Hive service and executes queries locally.  

#### ✅ **How to Use Hive CLI**  
- Open the terminal and type:  
  ```bash
  $ hive
  ```
- This starts the Hive command-line interface, and you’ll see the prompt:  
  ```bash
  hive>
  ```
- You can now type queries directly into Hive.  

👉 **Example Query:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees LIMIT 10;
```
This retrieves the first 10 records from the `employees` table.  

---

### 🌐 **Beeline (New Hive Client)**  
Beeline is a **newer, lightweight command-line client** designed to connect to **HiveServer2** instead of running locally. Unlike Hive CLI, it allows multiple users to connect remotely using **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity).  

#### ✅ **How to Use Beeline**  
- Open the terminal and type:  
  ```bash
  $ beeline -u url -n username -p password
  ```
- This connects to a **HiveServer2 instance** with the given credentials.  
- Once connected, you can execute queries using the `beeline>` prompt.  

👉 **Example Query:**  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_data;
```
This counts the total number of rows in the `sales_data` table.

# 🏗️ **Defining a Hive-Managed Table**  

### 📌 **What is a Hive-Managed Table?**  
A **Hive-managed table** (also known as an **internal table**) is a table where Hive **manages both the metadata and the actual data**. When you create a managed table, Hive **stores the data in a specific location in HDFS**, and **deleting the table removes both the metadata and the data**.  

---

### 📝 **Table Definition in Hive**  

Here's the standard way to define a **Hive-managed table**:  

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer (
    customerID INT,
    firstName STRING,
    lastName STRING,
    birthday TIMESTAMP
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
```

#### 🛠️ **Breaking it Down:**  
✔ **CREATE TABLE customer** → Defines a new table named `customer`.  
✔ **customerID INT** → Integer column for storing customer IDs.  
✔ **firstName STRING** → Text-based column for first names.  
✔ **lastName STRING** → Text-based column for last names.  
✔ **birthday TIMESTAMP** → Stores date and time information.  
✔ **ROW FORMAT DELIMITED** → Specifies the data format.  
✔ **FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','** → Defines `comma` as the separator between values.  

---

### 🎯 **Example Data for This Table**  
Imagine you have a CSV file with customer data formatted like this:  

```csv
101,John,Doe,1990-05-21 12:34:56  
102,Jane,Smith,1992-08-15 09:30:00  
103,Sam,Johnson,1988-11-03 14:00:30  
```

When this data is loaded into Hive, it will be structured into a table format, making it **easy to query and analyze**.  

---


# 🏗️ **Defining an External Table in Hive**  

### 📌 **What is an External Table?**  
An **external table** in Hive allows users to store data **outside** of Hive’s managed storage system. Unlike **managed tables**, where Hive **deletes the data when the table is dropped**, external tables **preserve the data** even if the table is removed.  

### 📝 **Creating an External Table**  

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE salaries (
    gender STRING,
    age INT,
    salary DOUBLE,
    zip INT
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',';
```

#### 🛠️ **Breaking it Down:**  
✔ **CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE salaries** → Defines an external table named `salaries`.  
✔ **gender STRING** → Stores gender as text.  
✔ **age INT** → Stores numerical age values.  
✔ **salary DOUBLE** → Stores salary with decimal precision.  
✔ **zip INT** → Stores zip codes as integer values.  
✔ **ROW FORMAT DELIMITED** → Specifies that fields are **separated** using a delimiter.  
✔ **FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','** → Defines `comma` as the separator between values.  

---

### 📂 **Defining a Table LOCATION**  

Sometimes, you may need to store the data in **a specific location** in HDFS while still using an external table. This ensures that Hive **references** the existing data **without moving** it to Hive’s default warehouse directory.  

```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE salaries (
    gender STRING,
    age INT,
    salary DOUBLE,
    zip INT
) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LOCATION '/user/train/salaries/';
```

✔ **LOCATION '/user/train/salaries/'** → Specifies where the data is physically stored in HDFS.  

💡 **Key Difference:**  
- **Internal Table:** Hive **manages** data storage. If you drop the table, the data is deleted.  
- **External Table:** Hive **only tracks metadata** while the actual data stays in its HDFS location, even if the table is removed.  

---

# 📥 **Loading Data into Hive**  

Once tables are defined, you need to **load** data into Hive for querying. There are **two ways** to load data:  

### 🚀 **Loading Local Data into Hive**  

```sql
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/tmp/customers.csv'
OVERWRITE INTO TABLE customers;
```
✔ **LOCAL INPATH** → Loads data from a local file system.  
✔ **OVERWRITE INTO TABLE customers** → Overwrites existing data in the `customers` table.  

### 🌍 **Loading Data from HDFS**  

```sql
LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/train/customers.csv'
OVERWRITE INTO TABLE customers;
```
✔ **INPATH** → Loads data from HDFS instead of the local machine.  
✔ **OVERWRITE INTO TABLE customers** → Replaces existing records in Hive with new data from HDFS.  

### 🔄 **Inserting Data via Queries**  

You can also **insert data** into a table **from another table** using SQL queries:  

```sql
INSERT INTO TABLE birthdays
SELECT firstName, lastName, birthday
FROM customers
WHERE birthday IS NOT NULL;
```
✔ Selects first name, last name, and birthday from `customers` **where birthday exists**, and inserts the data into the `birthdays` table.  

---

# 🔍 **Performing Queries in Hive**  

Once data is loaded, you can start querying the tables just like **SQL databases**!  

### 📊 **Fetching All Data**  

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```
✔ Returns **all columns and rows** from the `customers` table.  

### 🎯 **Filtering & Sorting Data**  

```sql
FROM customers
SELECT firstName, lastName, address, zip
WHERE orderID > 0
ORDER BY zip;
```
✔ Filters customers **where orderID is greater than 0** and sorts results by `zip`.  

### 🔗 **Joining Tables**  

```sql
SELECT customers.*, orders.*
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON (customers.customerID = orders.customerID);
```
✔ Joins `customers` and `orders` tables **based on matching customer IDs**, combining data from both tables.
